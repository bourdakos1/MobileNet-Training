Creating a Cloud Object Storage instance gives us a reliable place to keep our training data. It also opens up the potential for data collection and collaboration, letting us collect user data and allowing a team of specialists to easily label it.

IBM Cloud offers a lite tier of object storage, which includes 25 GB of storage for free. (this is what we will be using throughout the tutorial)

To create an instance we first need to **log in** or **sign up** for [IBM Cloud](https://console.bluemix.net/).

Once logged in you should find your IBM Cloud dashboard. This is where we can create and manage IBM Cloud resources.

We want to create a new Cloud Object Storage instance so click the **Create resource** button.
