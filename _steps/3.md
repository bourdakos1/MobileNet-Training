Once we have an object storage instance we need a way to access our data from outside of IBM Cloud.
To do be able to do this we need to create a set credentials for our resource.

We can do this by navigating to the **Service credentials** tab and clicking the **New credential** button.

You can leave all the options blank, but make sure the credential has the role of **Writer**.

Once added, click the **View credentials â–¾** dropdown and take note of your **apikey** and **resource_instance_id**.

## Setup
All the code used in this tutorial can be found in [this git repository](https://github.com/bourdakos1/cloud-annotations).

`git clone` the repo and `cd` into it by running the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bourdakos1/Cloud-Annotations.git && cd Cloud-Annotations
```

Once the repo is cloned we can run the following script to conveniently prefill our credentials everywhere they are needed in the project:
```bash
python -m bucket.login
```
