Once we have an object storage instance we need a way to access our data from outside of IBM Cloud.
To do be able to do this we need to create a set credentials for our resource.

We can do this by navigating to the **Service credentials** tab and clicking the **New credential** button.

You can leave all the options blank, but make sure the credential has the role of **Writer**.

Once added, click the **View credentials â–¾** dropdown and take note of your **apikey** and **resource_instance_id**.

    "access_key_id": "...",
    "secret_access_key": "..."

## Setup
All the code used in this tutorial can be found in [this git repository](https://github.com/bourdakos1/cloud-annotations).

`git clone` the repo and `cd` into it by running the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bourdakos1/Cloud-Annotations.git && cd Cloud-Annotations
```

To train our model we will be using Python and the open source machine learning framework, TensorFlow.

To check if you have python installed run:
```
python --version; python3 --version
```
> At the time of writing TensorFlow requires Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, or 3.6 **(NOT 3.7)**

If you don't have Python installed you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-367/) from the official Python website. Or macOS users familiar with `homebrew` can install it by running:
```
brew install python
```

## Login
Once the repo is cloned we can run the following script to conveniently prefill our credentials everywhere they are needed in the project:
```bash
python -m bucket.login
```

> **Note:** If you are having issues with the login script or want to enter your credentials manually, just add your credentials to the following files:
* `.Credentials`
* `app-ios/ios-app/Core ML Vision/Credentials.plist`
* `app-ios/data-collector/Data Collector/Credentials.plist`
