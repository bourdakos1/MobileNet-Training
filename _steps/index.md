## The Cycle of Machine Learning
### Collect data
Everything revolves around an object storage bucket.

Image files added to your bucket automatically show up in the Cloud Annotation tool as unlabeled. As a convenience, an iOS app is provided that automatically uploads photos taken straight to your bucket.

### Label data
The Cloud Annotation tool allows you to quickly and easily label any image data you add. Once images are labeled in the tool, an annotations file is generated. The annotation file is a simple csv with all your image urls and it's label.

### Train/retrain a model with the labeled data
The annotations generated by the Cloud Annotation tool can be used to create a model through any method of your choosing. Two convenience scripts are provided. One to train a Core ML model using Watson Visual Recognition and one to train a MobileNet CoreML model using Keras/TensorFlow.

### Model Deployment
The two scripts provided automatically upload your fully trained model to your object storage bucket. As a convenience, another iOS app is provided that checks your bucket for any updates to the model. If updates are available they are automatically downloaded and compiled inside the users app.

To allow for development and testing of models without interfering with your production apps, you can set branch flags for your model.
