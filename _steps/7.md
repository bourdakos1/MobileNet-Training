After we have collected and labeled our first round of images, we are ready train our model! Training the model is broken up into 3 parts:
1. Download the training data
2. Train a TensorFlow model
3. Convert the model to Core ML and TensorFlow Lite


## Installation
To train our model we will be using Python and the open source machine learning framework, TensorFlow.

To check if you have python installed run:
```
python --version; python3 --version
```
> At the time of writing TensorFlow requires Python 3.4, 3.5, or 3.6 **(NOT 3.7)**

If you don't have Python installed you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-367/) from the official Python website. Or macOS users familiar with homebrew can install it by running:
```
brew install python
```

We then need to install the rest of the requirements by running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install git+https://github.com/apple/coremltools
pip install tfcoreml
```

## Download the training data
We can download our training data by running the following command:
```
python -m bucket.download
```

The script will download the image data in our bucket and organize it into folders under the directory `.tmp/training_data`.

## Train a TensorFlow model
// Talk about the model and hyper parameters and fun jazz. epochs, number of steps yada yada...
```
python -m scripts.retrain
```
At this point if you have no interest in running your model on mobile devices, you can skip to the [next step](8).

## Convert the model to Core ML and TensorFlow Lite
We can convert our model to a mobile usable format by running:
```
python -m scripts.convert --coreml --tflite
```
This script will generate an `.mlmodel` and `.tflite` file from our TensorFlow graph, which are compatible with iOS and Android respectively.
