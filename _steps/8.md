To test the model locally on our computer we can run this command:
```
python -m scripts.label_image \
  --image="image_url_or_path"
```

<img width="224" height="224" style="background-color: #f6f8fa; border-radius: 3px;" src="https://img.saveur-biere.com/img/p/3758-15520-product_img_sb3.jpg">

You should see results similar to this for a photo of Brooklyn Lager:
```

Woodchuck Hard Cider (score=0.00595)
NEITHER (score=0.00252)
```
